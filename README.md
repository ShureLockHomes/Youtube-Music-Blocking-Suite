# Youtube-Music-Blocking-Suite

Ever wanted your music streaming service to have basic features and for them to work properly? Ever had an album you didnt like plastered on your screen in the "forgotten favorites" section for months on end? Have you tried blocking an artist on youtube, disliking all their songs, and still had them promoted to you?

This FireFox extension will allow you to:

- Block everything with an artists name from appearing on your home screen/search results. . . or anywhere in general
- Automatically dislike/skip any of their songs you come across

It comes pre-loaded with anti-pedophile measures, such as blocking drake.
